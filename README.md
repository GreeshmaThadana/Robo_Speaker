Robo_Speaker:

The provided Python script represents a simple interactive program for a Robo Speaker 1.1 created by Greesh. The program utilizes the `os` module to enable text-to-speech functionality on the user's input. It continuously prompts the user to enter phrases, converting each input into speech using the "say" command. The program runs indefinitely until the user inputs "q," at which point it gracefully concludes by saying "bye bye friend, end of talking." The script showcases a basic implementation of a text-to-speech interface using Python, providing a user-friendly interaction with the Robo Speaker.
